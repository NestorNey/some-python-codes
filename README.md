# Some python codes

Here you can find some code that I did during cisco's python course and some that I did afterwards, interfaces for dall-e and chatgpt (just the basics of how to connect them and how you could introduce them to your project)

The content in this repository are in Spanish but it are used only in the menus, most variables and methods are in English. Feel free to translate the code with a translator or chatgpt.

You are free to copy and change any code inside this repository :)
